#Welcome to my project on GitHub.
##My history
I'm a developer that continuously is executing different kind of long tasks and I get really nervous while the execution, to the point of being unable to sleep. This need made me to realize that there were no easy form of knowing if task has been succesful or not without connecting to the server, so I thought that It would be useful to receive notifications on my Android phone that explains how the things are going, maybe an IOException has occurred and I can fix it in a moment avoiding to waste precious CPU time. That's my history!

##Are these libraries useful?
I hope so, in my little experience they are very useful. Besides the prior anounced uses, this libraries are also useful for System Admins, for different tasks, I don't know, for example brute-force telnet/ssh attacks can be detected in real time by receiving an notification when an user puts its password incorrectly five times in a row. Maybe, a technical service assistant would like to provide an VIP treatment to an specific client by knowing when the product has failed and resolving it before even get officially notified about the error.

##FAQ
###How do I pair the library with my smartphone?
Simple, you only need to download the App from the Play Store, and create a key for a computer language, for example, a 
Python Key. (This is only a measure to avoid being flood of notifications from malicious software/people. Then, when you want to send a message, you'll only need to use the function sendNot('your@email.com','languageKey','message'). Personally, I higly recommend to make it in a separated thread.

###For what languages is this library available?
In principle I will only write the libraries for the main computer languages C++, Java, MATLAB, Python, Ruby, PHP and UNIX Bash and, of course the Android Client, since I do not own any Apple Computer I won't be able to make the iOS client, however, I encourage you to write it and publish it on the App Store.

###When will it be available?
The libraries are going to be posted during these next two weeks in Alpha Release, and the Android Client will be downloable from the Play Store on Jan 1st at 00.01 AM GMT:+01:00 (I really hope Google allow this).
